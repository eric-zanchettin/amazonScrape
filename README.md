<h1>Project: Amazon Scrape ⛏</h1>
<p>This is an simple project created to web scrape Amazon Website. The idea is too get name and price info from the resulting search defined by the program!
I used "iPhone" as the search value but you can easily change it on the code font on main.py on the field</p>
<code>"search_value = 'iPhone'"</code></br>
</br>
that can be found on line 13.

<h1>👨🏼‍💻 Technologies</h1>
<p>On the development of this project i used <b>Python</b> as the main language and the following frameworks:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Selenium Webdriver:</b> To access the Internet and interact with the HTML elements;</li>
  <li><b>pandas:</b> Used to generate an .xlsx Spreadsheet that will organize the scraped info;</li>
  <li><b>openpyxl:</b> As an complement to pandas (allow to save .xlsx files);</li>
  <li><b>Tkinter:</b> A litte bit of Tkinter just to ask where to save the spreadsheet.</li>
</ul>
